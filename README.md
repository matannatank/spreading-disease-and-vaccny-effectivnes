# Simulating the Spread of a Disease with Stochastic and Deterministic Models

## Project Overview
This project models the spread of infectious diseases using two approaches:
1. **Deterministic SIR and SVIR Models**: Based on differential equations to predict overall epidemic trends.
2. **Stochastic Agent-Based Model**: Simulates individual interactions with randomness to capture real-world variability.

The project also explores the effects of **vaccination** and **immunity loss** on disease dynamics.

---

## Goals
- Compare deterministic and stochastic models to study disease propagation.
- Analyze how vaccination and immunity loss affect disease outcomes.
- Provide visual insights through simulation and graphs.

---

## Features
- **Deterministic Models**: SIR and SVIR models with mortality and vaccination.
- **Stochastic Models**: Agent-based approach simulating individual-level variability.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots to compare results between models.
